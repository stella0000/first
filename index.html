        <h1>5 Characters Who Have Gotten Me Through Quarantine</h1>
        <p>It's been an isolating time, but I've found connection and happiness 
            in a few characters. Netflix and Hulu and an unnamed illegal site 
            (I'm kidding, for legal reasons), I thank you for introducing me 
            to these 5 heroes.</p>

        <h2>Aang</h2>
        <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>

        <p>Aang is so special. Why?</p>
        <!-- for numbered list: ol, for unorganized list: ul-->
        <ol>
            <li>He is the only surviving airbender.</li>
            <li>He chooses not to kill the Firelord because it just doesn't sit right with him.</li>
            <li>He is over 100 years old, but does not look a day over 12!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I am so proud of him.</p>
